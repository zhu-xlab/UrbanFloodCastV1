## Overview
UrbanFloodCastV2 leverages deep learning techniques to forecast urban flooding based on hydrology data. The project uses a variety of libraries and tools for data preprocessing, model building, and visualization.

## Data pixelization
1. Directly use the processed data: The pixelized data required for model training and evaluation can be downloaded from test_data folder in the following link:

[Pixelized Data](https://syncandshare.lrz.de/getlink/fiPWiw7f7nsxXXPBWVN7g/checkpoints)

2. Use .txt files to get .pt data, you can process the data using the script provided in `process.ipynb`. This can help convert .txt to .tif files. After processing, `save_pt.ipynb` can help convert .tif to .pt files. The txt files, DEM and ground truth can be found in test_data folder in [Raw Data](https://syncandshare.lrz.de/getlink/fiPWiw7f7nsxXXPBWVN7g/checkpoints)

## Model Training
We prepared the pre-trained model checkpoints: [Checkpoints](https://syncandshare.lrz.de/getlink/fiPWiw7f7nsxXXPBWVN7g/checkpoints) Please download model.pt and put in the `save` folder.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zhu-xlab/UrbanFloodCastV1.git
   cd UrbanFloodCastV1

2. **Install the required dependencies: You can install all the required libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
To use the model, execute the following steps:
   
1. **Download test data and pretrained model checkpoints. Put in the corresponding folder.**
   
2. **Please change all the path to your local path in `load_model_v2.ipynb`.**

3. **Test the model using the `load_model_v2.ipynb` notebook.**

# Model Evaluation Metrics

This repository provides an overview of key evaluation metrics used in hydrological and machine learning models for flood/runoff prediction.

## Metrics Explained
**General Lp Loss**:
   - For any positive real number \( p \), the Lp Loss is:
     ```math
     \text{Lp Loss} = \| \hat{y} - y \|_p = \left( \sum_{i=1}^n |\hat{y}_i - y_i|^p \right)^{1/p}
     ```
   - Characteristics: Flexible, can be tuned for specific tasks.

---

### 1. Test (RMSE or MSE)
This value likely represents either the **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** or **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, which measure the deviation between predicted and observed values.

#### **Formula:**
**RMSE:**
```math
RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum (y_{pred} - y_{obs})^2}
```
**MSE:**
```math
MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum (y_{pred} - y_{obs})^2
```
- **Lower RMSE/MSE indicates better model performance.**

**Test value: `0.3927` → Low error, good performance.**

---

### 2. Test_nse (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency, NSE)
Measures how well the predicted values fit the observed values.

#### **Formula:**
```math
NSE = 1 - \frac{\sum (y_{obs} - y_{pred})^2}{\sum (y_{obs} - \bar{y}_{obs})^2}
```
- **NSE = 1** → Perfect model performance.
- **NSE > 0.75** → Good model performance.
- **NSE > 0.5** → Acceptable but needs improvement.
- **NSE < 0** → Worse than using the mean.

**Test value: `0.9371` → Excellent performance.**

---

### 3. Test_corr (Correlation Coefficient, R)
Measures the linear relationship between predicted and observed values.

#### **Formula (Pearson Correlation):**
```math
r = \frac{\sum (y_{obs} - \bar{y}_{obs}) (y_{pred} - \bar{y}_{pred})}{\sqrt{\sum (y_{obs} - \bar{y}_{obs})^2} \sqrt{\sum (y_{pred} - \bar{y}_{pred})^2}}
```
- **R = 1** → Perfect positive correlation.
- **R = 0** → No correlation.
- **R = -1** → Perfect negative correlation.

**Test value: `0.9684` → Strong correlation between predictions and observations.**

---

### 4. Test_csi_1, Test_csi_2, Test_csi_3 (Critical Success Index, CSI)
Used for evaluating flood/runoff event detection at different thresholds.

#### **Formula:**
```math
CSI = \frac{TP}{TP + FN + FP}
```
- **TP (True Positive):** Correctly predicted flood/runoff events.
- **FP (False Positive):** Incorrectly predicted flood/runoff events.
- **FN (False Negative):** Missed flood/runoff events.
- **CSI = 1** → Perfect prediction.
- **CSI = 0** → Completely failed prediction.

**Test values:**
- **Test_csi_1 = `0.7291`**
- **Test_csi_2 = `0.7807`**
- **Test_csi_3 = `0.7942`**

**Interpretation: Model is effective in detecting flood events (>0.7 indicates good detection performance).**
